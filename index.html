        <h1> Abstract </h1>
        <p>Music. Experts have been trying for a long time to understand sound and what differenciates one song from another. How to visualize sound. What makes a tone different from another. The music industry has undergone major changes from its conventional existence and also in the form of music created in last few years. The ever-growing customer base has also increased the market for different music styles. Music not only bring the individuals together, but also provides insight for various cultures. Therefore, it is essential to classify the music according to the genres to satisfy the needs of the people categorically. The manual ranking of music is a repetitive, lengthy task and the duty lies with the listener. The proposed research work has compared few classification models. This work has trained and compared the proposed models on GTZAN dataset, where most of the models were audio file trains, while a few of the models were trained on the spectrogram. In this notebook we will go through an in depth analysis of sound and how we can visualize, classify and ultimately understand it.</p>

                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    Music Genre Classification is a pivotal domain bridging audio processing and
machine learning. It entails crafting algorithms to classify audio files into genres
like jazz, rock, classical, and hip-hop. This task is crucial for recommendation
systems, music indexing, and playlist customization.
In this report, we delve into the nuances of Music Genre Classification,
unraveling its challenges, insights, and methodologies, aiming to furnish a com-
prehensive overview of the problem statement, major findings, and the reportâ€™s
structure
                </p>
             
                <p>Humans have devised and employed musical genres as labels to describe and classify the broad field of music. Because they emerge from a complex interplay between the public, marketing, historical, and cultural influences, musical genres lack clear definitions and bounds. A new genre classification approach for the sole purpose of music information retrieval has been proposed by several scholars. But even with today's musical genres, it is evident that members of a certain genre often have some things in common when it comes to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and pitch content of the song.</p>
                <p>In this Page, how to handle sound files in python, compute sound and audio features from them, and run machine learning algorithms on them are addressed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="method">
                <h1>Methodology</h1>
                <p>The methodology for music genre classification involved the following key steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> <span class="description">The dataset was obtained from the GTZAN Dataset, a widely used collection of audio files spanning various music genres.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong><span class="description"> Relevant features were extracted from the audio files using the librosa library in Python. These features included tempo, spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> <span class="description"> Before training the machine learning models, the extracted features underwent preprocessing. This process involved scaling the features to a standard range and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong><Different class="description">Different machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were experimented with to determine the best performer for music genre classification.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> <The class="description">The performance of each model was evaluated using techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to tune hyperparameters. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were assessed to gauge the effectiveness of each model.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Following this methodology, a series of experiments were conducted to build and evaluate machine learning models capable of accurately classifying music genres based on audio features.</p>

            <h1>Music Genre Classifiers</h1>
            <p>In the pursuit of music genre classification, a diverse array of machine learning methods were explored, each showcasing unique characteristics and performance. Below provides a concise overview of the methodologies employed:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Decision Tree Classifier:</strong> The initial approach involved the utilization of Decision Trees, which segment the feature space into hierarchical decision rules. Through the application of Grid-SearchCV, hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize classification accuracy. Despite its simplicity, Decision Trees served as a robust baseline for genre classification tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AdaBoost Classifier:</strong> Recognizing the limitations of Decision Trees, an ensemble learning technique known as AdaBoost was adopted. AdaBoost combines multiple weak classifiers to form a stronger ensemble model. Various hyperparameter combinations, such as the number of estimators and learning rate, were explored to enhance classification performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier:</strong> Another explored method was the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic model that assumes feature independence given the class label. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes demonstrated rapid training times and competitive performance in genre classification tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Lastly, Logistic Regression, a linear model well-suited for multiclass classification, was investigated. Parameter tuning, including adjustments to regularization strength (C) and penalty type, aimed to identify the optimal configuration for precise genre classification.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Classifier:</strong> Additionally, the KNN classifier was explored, which is a non-parametric method used for classification. It classifies objects based on the majority class among their k nearest neighbors in the feature space. By adjusting the number of neighbors (k), we aimed to find an optimal balance between local and global information for accurate genre classification.
                </li>

            </ol>
            <p>Each method underwent rigorous evaluation using cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization. Performance was assessed based on mean accuracy scores derived from multiple folds.</p>
            <p>Through this extensive exploration, the aim was to identify the most effective approach for music genre classification, considering factors such as accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.</p>
